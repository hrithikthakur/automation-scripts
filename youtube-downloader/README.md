## [YouTube Video Downloader](yt_downloader.py)

Unlock the secrets of ad-free, high-resolution YouTube videos without shelling out for a premium subscription. This Python script takes a YouTube video URL as input and delivers a triple treat: unveiling video insights like title and views, capturing videos in the highest resolution possible, and neatly organizing your downloads in a folder of your choice. It uses the `pytube` library to download the highest resolution video from a given YouTube link as a parameter and performs the following actions:
  -- Retrieves video information such as title and views.
  -- Downloads the video in the highest available resolution.
  -- Saves the downloaded video to a specified folder.

**Usage:**

```bash
python download_youtube.py <YouTube_URL>
```
